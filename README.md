# discourse-header-theme-toggle

I've built a simple toggle for the header that switches between two themes on click.

In the theme component's settings, you can define the two themes and optionally enable immediate reloading (sometimes required for more complex themes).

:warning: **Please note**

* Both themes must have `Theme can be selected by users` enabled, and both themes must also have this theme component added.  

* The theme name is used in the toggle. I strongly recommend short names!

* I have not yet added mobile support, so this only works on desktop for now
